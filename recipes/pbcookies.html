        <h4>Versatile, fun, quick and easy to make!</h4>

        <p>This cookie is a close relative of the curabié, that little Turkish pIf you want to make them with homemade peanut
        butter, of course you can and it comes out exactly the same. (like those little chocolate chips that melt
        a bit in the oven and never go back to solid solid… SO Yummy!).</p>

        <ul>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

            <li>1 cup of flour: it can be whole wheat, rice or almond flour or oatmeal.</li>
            <li>1 cup of peanut butter or tahini (sesame paste, available in natural and gourmet stores). Both can be made homemade or
                replaced with homemade paste of any other dried fruit: almonds, cashews, etc.</li>
            <li>½ cup of honey (or agave, or sweetener of your choice)</li>    
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
            <li>½ cup of chopped chocolate</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li> Optional: 1 tablespoon vanilla, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, orange zest, etc.</li>
            

        </ul>
        <ol>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <li>Combine all the ingredients by hand or with a blender, except for the flour, bicarbonate of soda and chopped chocolate.
                (If the peanut or tahini paste is very solid, they can be loosened a little in a water bath or with the closed jar under
                warm running water, they quickly become more liquid. If you find a generous layer of oil on the pasta in the jar, don't
                be scared, it's normal, just mix it back up.)</li>
            <li>Once all of the above is integrated in a bowl, incorporate the flour and baking soda with a spatula or even simply
                by hand and finally add the chopped chocolate chips. If the dough is very loose and it is difficult for you to shape
                the cookies, take it to the refrigerator for half an hour. If not, preheat the oven to 180 degrees while placing the
                cookies on a greased or oiled baking sheet, a silicone baking mat could do the job also. You can give them the shape you like best, we made classic circles
                and letters.</li>
            <li>Let the cookies cool in the refrigerator for at least fifteen minutes. This step ensures that they
                don't crumble and melt in the oven before they cook through.</li>
            <li>Lastly, bake them in medium-low temperature, around 180 degrees, for between 10 and 12 minutes. They are tastier if we take
                them out before they brown, still just soft to the touch, not quite hard. They are then dried when cooled and are
                very tender inside.</li>

        </ol>
