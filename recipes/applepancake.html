        <h4>Quick and easy to make!</h4>

        <p>This is as close as I have found to the apple pancake at the Original Pancake House. A fluffy, sweet pancake.
            Excellent with a scoop of vanilla ice cream</p>
          
        <ul>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 large apple, cored and sliced</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar, divided</li>    
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>⅓ cup milk</li>
            <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
            

        </ul>
        <ol>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Melt butter in an oven-safe skillet over medium heat; cook and stir apple slices, about 1/4 cup sugar, and cinnamon
                in butter until apples are tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs, milk, flour, remaining 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl until
                batter is smooth; pour batter evenly over apples.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Run a spatula around the edges of the pancake to
                loosen. Invert skillet over a large plate to serve.</li>
